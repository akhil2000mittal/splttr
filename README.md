Have you ever been confused splitting bills among friends, been scratching your head with your last trips expenses, wondered how much do you really owe someone or how much they owe you? SPLTTR is a one – place solution to all these problems.

Currently in planning phase, this mobile application would let you manage all these expenses with just a few taps. You can add friends individually or in a group, easily managing all your bills, borrowings and future outings. The application also gives you support to keep a record of your personal expenses allowing you to keep an eye on your budget easily.

Planned to be developed using Flutter SDK, the application would make use of “sqflite” flutter package to maintain a database and locally store all transactions. This makes the application usable without any network connection and be accessible all time to the user. The Flutter SDK makes the application available for both Android and IOS.
