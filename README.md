# Introduction

One of the biggest problems in student lives is managing money and keeping a record of this. Having to maintain a budget because of limited pocket money is a prominent issue in their lives. To address the same issue we bring a mobile application, SPLTTR, a one-place solution to most of your expense problems.


# The Application

Currently in the planning phase, this application would let you manage all these expenses with just a few taps.
-	Add friends individually or form a group you mostly go out with, easily splitting all your bills, trip expenses or any get-togethers, easily managing them or any of your borrowings.
-	Generate a REPORT, recording all the expenses telling who owes what and HOW!
-	Keep a record of your personal expenses, something that allows you to keep an eye on your budget easily.
-	Give your peers a whatsapp reminder or call them directly from within the application to let them know what amount they owe you.
Another prominent feature is the integrated support for paying your dues through online payment services like PayTM.


# Technology Used

Planned to be developed using Flutter SDK, the application would make use of “sqflite” flutter package to maintain a SQL database and locally store all transactions. This makes the application usable without any network connection and be accessible all time to the user. The Flutter SDK makes the application available for both Android and IOS. Future versions of the applications may include Firebase as an alternate backend for database management which adds the ability to manage all accounts in real - time.
